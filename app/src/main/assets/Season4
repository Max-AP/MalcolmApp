1^Zoo^Malcolm is depressed, and the family goes to the zoo. Reese battles a goat, while Malcolm and Dewey end up in a tiger pit. Dewey calms Malcolm long enough for Reese to save them by tossing the goat in the tiger pit. This experience makes Malcolm see his life in a whole new light. Francis and Piama's road trip across America results in them meeting a German couple named Otto (Kenneth Mars) and Gretchen (Meagen Fay) who offer Francis a job at their dude ranch. Lois' ex-boyfriend, Matt (Tim DeKay), works at the zoo and his demonstration of a tarantula on Hal results in Hal getting a nasty bite. While Hal recovers, Matt inadvertently reveals to him that Lois actually had a third boyfriend, leading to a serious confrontation between Hal and Lois.
2^Humilithon^Malcolm's first day of high school gets off to a bad start when Lois embarrasses him in front of the entire school, causing him to have no friends except the Krelboynes. He plans to commit a felony that would make Lois ship him off to military academy, but Cynthia warns him that if he does so, she will 'never have sex with him again' (lying and sacrificing her own reputation to save him). Lois and Hal volunteer in the school, where Hal clashes with Mr. Herkabe. With Malcolm and Reese away, Dewey stays home alone for the first time in his life and has a wonderful time. On the ranch, Francis begins getting overwhelmed with the workload due to Otto constantly allowing his employees to take extended breaks, without arranging anyone else to cover for their shifts, before being given his own truck for free.
3^Family Reunion^Francis and Piama visits just as the family goes to Hal's family reunion for his father's birthday, and Hal's family makes Lois miserable because she is from a lower-class family. Hal, Piama and the boys are furious for this and plot revenge on the family. Hal clashes with his father, Walter (Christopher Lloyd), and forces a confession from him by tickling him. The boys drive a golf cart over the celebration with the help of their younger cousins, destroying the party, and incurring the wrath of the adults. Even though Hal and Lois pretend to be angry at the boys, they are both proud of them for standing up to the family. Lois also finally starts treating Piama kindly, not wanting to turn out like her own in-laws.
4^Stupid Girl^Malcolm pretends to be stupid so he can win over a cute girl named Alison (Brittany Finamore) who really is stupid and soon finds that he is actually becoming dumber. Stevie wins Lois' approval and she takes him to the school dance. Hal rents a steamroller and becomes addicted to running over various objects until Dewey brings him back to his senses by standing in front of it. Meanwhile, Francis saves Otto from being conned by a con-artist selling him cow sunscreen.
5^Forwards Backwards^Days before Malcolm's birthday, he and Reese pull increasingly severe pranks against each other. Flashbacks throughout the episode gradually reveal how their feud began when Malcolm ate a blueberry Reese was saving. Dewey worries about his role as Abraham Lincoln in the school play and takes Lois' advice to imagine a set of parents, leading to a memorable performance. Hal enlists Craig to help him find Malcolm a birthday present, but is driven nuts by his constant demands. Although Craig calls off the deal, he rescues Hal from buying a bad comic book and forces the owner into negotiations. The comic book and all of Malcolm's presents end up going to Dewey as compensation for missing his play, due to Hal and Lois having to ground both Reese and Malcolm for their pranks. Meanwhile, Francis and Otto encounter a "devil cow" at the ranch and Francis discovers it is just an ordinary cow long overdue for milking.
6^Forbidden Girlfriend^Malcolm starts to date Nikki (Reagan Dale Neis), a girl from his school that he tutors in his free time. The only problem is her dad, who dislikes him, and things are made worse when Lois is involved. Hal and Lois take abstinence pills in an attempt to be better parents, but the pills run out and they have a hard time staying apart. At the ranch, Otto is furious with a neighboring ranch constantly destroying the fence that Francis is building to keep the cattle inside, so that their own horses can reach water. In the end, Francis comes up with a simple solution of adding a gate in the fence.
7^Malcolm Holds His Tongue^Malcolm decides to keep his opinions to himself, but he becomes so repressed that he is hospitalized with a stomach ulcer. Reese must enlist Craig to drive him and his girlfriend, Alison, to a concert. When Reese learns that Craig wants to go on a hayride date and won't let him renege, Alison ditches Reese to go to the concert alone, and he is forced to spend the evening with Craig. Hal starts practicing race-walking, and ends up having talents for it, until he makes a fierce rival, Wheeler. Hal also decides to take on a local speed-walker and buys a speed walking outfit. Hal makes a run at beating this "common jogger", after learning Wheeler's dirty secret. Francis has just received an expensive pair of boots from Hal but soaks them in water to make them completely fit in their boots.
8^Boys at the Ranch^Hal and the boys visit Francis at the ranch. Everyone is shocked to find that Francis is a lot different from whom they remember. As Hal laments that the ranch succeeded where he failed in instilling responsibility in Francis, the boys try to restore Francis to his old self by revealing a secret stash full of rockets and fireworks. Hal and Otto get drunk and end up stranded in the desert during the night. The boys set off the fireworks, helping to rescue Otto and Hal but blinding themselves. Absent: Jane Kaczmarek as Lois
9^Grandma Sues^Francis and Piama visit the family the same day Grandma Ida's last day of visit. However, Grandma Ida is injured by slipping on leaves Reese neglected to rake up, and she sues Lois and Hal â€“ just when Lois discovers that she is pregnant. To make matters worse, she hires an expensive lawyer and sues for a vast sum. This turns to horror when their insurance company cancels their policy via a loophole, which could lead to Ida evicting them from their own home and taking all of their belongings due to them not being able to afford the out-of-pocket costs. The boys band together with Piama in support for Hal and Lois. However, upon learning that the family has no insurance, the lawyer refuses to aid Ida (since he won't make but pennies off of the settlement), who immediately decides to leave before she can be kicked out.
10^If Boys Were Girls^Hal asks Lois if she would like the new baby to be another boy or a girl, but they are interrupted by the boys fighting. During a hellish trip to the mall with Hal, an exasperated Lois imagines life with daughters instead of sons, with Reese as Renee (Mimi Paley), Malcolm as Mallory (Lisa Foiles), and Dewey as Daisy (Jennette McCurdy). Though the fantasy starts pleasantly, Lois soon discovers the problems with raising girls: Renee is a promiscuous bad girl who is pregnant by Mallory's crush, Mallory is a selfish and egotistical brat who is secretly on a diet, and Daisy is a master manipulator. The problems are made worse with the arrival of Francis/Frances, who had rebelled against Lois, left college, and married a deadbeat. The girls gang up and blame Lois for all of their problems, just as the boys had done earlier, making Lois realize that girls are just as difficult to raise as boys. In the real world, Hal desperately searches for the perfect Valentine's Day present for Lois and settles for a baby's outfit. Though the boys are well-behaved for once and have thoughtfully bought a heart-shaped candy box, Lois still wishes for the new baby to be a girl.
11^Long Drive^Reese is sent to prison for a day, where he clashes with a wrestler imprisoned for beating a man to death. Lois takes Malcolm on a lengthy drive to her sister's house, during which she tells him everything about sex. At first Malcolm is horrified, but they end up having a pleasant conversation. Dewey creates a feud in Hal's six-man band for his amusement. At the ranch, Francis blows up Otto's favorite cow, Helga, in a branding accident, and cannot bring himself to tell him.
12^Kicked Out^A combination of Malcolm's disgust at the house falling apart around them, and Hal's fear-induced "zero tolerance" attempts at maintaining peace and order in the family, results in Malcolm being kicked out of the house. The longer he has no home, the more his sanity begins to slip away. Hal finds Malcolm at his ex-girlfriend's house and agrees to keep this between them, knowing that Lois would have gone through greater lengths to find him. At the ranch, Otto's family arrives and Francis has to deal with Otto's piano-playing nephew who intentionally annoys him, which leads to him smashing his piano in front of Otto's family. Reese attaches a fire hose to his back for more speed on his bike, which ends in a disaster. Absent: Jane Kaczmarek as Lois

However, he ends up in trouble with the FCC. Malcolm finds an old computer worth thousands of dollars and arranges to sell it to Craig. At the last second, Hal pulls Craig away to help continue transmitting his radio show, and Reese intentionally destroys the computer.

Dewey keeps playing stunts, using the excuse that the baby "told" him to.
